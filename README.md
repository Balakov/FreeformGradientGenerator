Adobe Illustrator CC has a funky freeform gradient tool that has no equivalent in the design software I use (Affinity Designer & Inkscape), and there's really no way of working around it.

This is my attempt to bypass that restriction. It's just interpolating colours, how hard can it be! It's actually a bit more difficult than I estimated, and I'm almost certain this isn't the best way of doing it. The maths in here is dodgy for sure, but it works well enough for my needs.

Also the UI is awful, please don't judge me on that. It would be really nice to be able to drag the size of rectangular colour points instead of using input sliders, but rectangular colour points aren't actually that useful, so I didn't bother tidying it up.
